2. Introduction
2.1 Overview
The Community Item Sharing Platform is a web and mobile application that enables users to post, rent, buy, or give away general items (e.g., lawnmowers, hoses, vacuum cleaners) within their local community. It allows users to:
List items for sale, rent, or auction.


Search and filter based on location, category, and availability.


Prevent conflicts through double-booking checks and automated late-return alerts.


Communicate in real time using an in-app chat system.


The application builds community trust via user profiles, ratings, and transaction histories. It is designed to reduce waste and cost while strengthening local sharing networks.

2.2 Problem Description
Current Market Gap:
 Platforms like OLX focus on buy/sell only, while apps like OLIO focus on free sharing, leaving a gap in renting or time-limited sharing. A hybrid platform that allows buy + rent + auction does not exist in a community-centric, geo-location-driven format.
Key Problems to Solve:
Double Bookings: Prevent overlapping rentals for the same item.


Late Returns: Reminders and penalty options.


Trust & Communication: Secure chat and rating system for safe handoffs.


Local Discovery: Geo-location and proximity-based item discovery.


2.3 Stakeholders
End Users: Individuals looking to rent or sell their items or borrow instead of buying.


Admin/Moderators: Oversee listings, handle dispute resolution, and monitor community activity.


Developers: Responsible for building and maintaining the platform.


Payment Partners: Stripe/PayPal for transactions.


2.4 Glossary / Terminology
Listing: An item posted by a user for sale, rent, or auction.


Booking: A confirmed rental agreement between the owner and borrower.


Auction: A bidding process where the highest bidder wins the item.


Return Status: Indicates whether an item has been returned (on time or late).


2.5 Context & Background
Why This Problem Matters: Many households have unused items. Renting them saves costs and promotes sustainability.


Previous Attempts: Traditional classified apps (OLX, Craigslist) lack rental & community trust features.


Alignment with Goals: Supports local economy, sustainability, and aligns with modern sharing economy trends.


2.6 Goals
Functional Goals:
Item Listings: Create, edit, delete, and manage listings with photos and details.


Rental Management: Support date-based bookings, prevent double bookings, and track returns.


Payments: Allow online payments for purchases and rentals.


Bidding System: Enable auctions for items.


Real-Time Communication: Chat between buyers/renters and owners.


Notifications: Alerts for bookings, returns, and inquiries.


Technical Goals:
API-first architecture with scalable microservices.


Secure authentication (JWT-based).


Cloud-based image storage (AWS S3).


Event-driven notifications via Firebase or WebSockets.


2.7 Non-Goals
No support for large delivery logistics.


No advanced legal contracts for rentals in Phase 1.


2.8 Future Goals
AI-based recommendations (suggesting items based on user behavior).


Escrow or deposit system for high-value rentals.


Premium subscriptions for boosted listings.


2.9 Assumptions
Users will have smartphones and internet access.


Geo-location will be enabled.


All transactions are peer-to-peer (no heavy logistics).



3. Expanded High-Level Design (HLD)
The architecture follows a 3-tier design with modular backend services and cloud integrations.
3.1 Architecture Diagram (PlantUML Code)



3.2 Core Modules
Auth Service: Manages user login, signup, JWT token generation, and password resets.


Item Listing Service: CRUD operations for items (with search & filters).


Booking Service: Rental management, conflict checks, late return tracking.


Chat Service: Real-time WebSocket-based messaging.


Notification Service: Alerts for booking confirmations, late returns, and auctions.


Payment Service: Stripe integration for secure transactions.

4. Further Considerations
4.1 Impact on Other Teams
Customer Support: Needs clear workflows to resolve disputes (e.g., late returns, damaged items).


Moderation Team: Requires tools for reporting and removing inappropriate listings.


Payments/Finance: Requires secure integration with Stripe/PayPal for refund and dispute resolution.


4.2 Third-Party Services and Platforms
Stripe/PayPal:


Pros: Secure, widely accepted, handles disputes.


Cons: Transaction fees.


Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM): For push notifications.


AWS S3: For scalable item photo storage.


Geo-Location (Google Maps API): To show items nearby.


4.3 Cost Analysis
MVP Cloud Costs (Estimate):


AWS S3 + EC2: ~$20–30/month.


Firebase Notifications: Free tier sufficient for MVP.


Stripe: 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction.


Supabase/PostgreSQL hosting: ~$25/month (basic plan).


4.4 Security Considerations
Authentication: JWT tokens with refresh tokens.


Data Encryption: HTTPS for all endpoints, at-rest encryption for sensitive data (PostgreSQL + S3).


Threats: Account takeover attempts, malicious item postings.


Mitigation: Rate-limiting, content moderation, and CAPTCHA on sign-up.


4.5 Privacy Considerations
Location Privacy: Only show approximate user locations (e.g., area-level, not full address).


Data Retention: Automatically delete old chat history after 6 months.


GDPR Compliance: Offer data deletion on request.


4.6 Regional Considerations
Localization: Multi-language support planned in Phase 2.


Latency: Optimize CDN for serving images from S3.


Legal: Ensure rentals comply with local commerce laws.


4.7 Accessibility
WCAG-compliant UI.


Screen-reader support.


Keyboard-friendly navigation.


4.8 Operational Considerations
Failure Recovery: Auto-retry for failed payments and push notifications.


Backups: Daily snapshots of PostgreSQL and S3.


Scalability: Use horizontal scaling for the Node.js backend with a load balancer.


4.9 Risks
Dispute Risk: Users may return damaged items → handled via reporting system.


Scalability Risk: If traffic spikes (e.g., 50k concurrent users), must autoscale on cloud.


4.10 Support Considerations
In-app FAQ.


Email-based escalation for disputes.


Admin dashboard for quick response.



5. Success Evaluation
5.1 Impact
Security Impact: Strengthened trust due to in-app ratings and secure communication.


Performance Impact: API response under 300ms on average for 90% of requests.


Cost Impact: MVP designed to stay under $100/month during pilot stage.


5.2 Metrics
User Activity Metrics:


Daily Active Users (DAU).


Number of successful rentals per day.


Average time to book an item.


System Health Metrics:


API uptime (target 99.5%).


DB query latency.


Error rate (<1%).


Business KPIs:


Revenue from transactions.


Repeat rentals per user.


5.3 Monitoring & Alerting
Tools:


Prometheus + Grafana for API metrics.


AWS CloudWatch for server health.


Sentry for error tracking.


Alerts: Slack notifications when API error rates exceed thresholds.


5.4 Test Plan
Unit Tests: For booking logic, API endpoints, and validation.


Integration Tests: Payment flow, chat feature, booking overlaps.


End-to-End Tests: Simulate renting, returning, and late return scenarios.


5.5 Roll-Out Plan
Phase 1: Invite-only beta (small community test).


Phase 2: Public launch in one city.


Phase 3: Expand to multiple cities with scaling optimizations.


5.6 Rollback Plan
Feature flags for disabling problematic modules (e.g., auction system).


Backup database snapshots for restoring item and booking data.

6.5 Future Work
Phase 2: AI-powered search and recommendation engine.


Phase 3: Add deposit/escrow system for rentals.


Phase 4: Expand multi-language support and internationalization.



7. Deliberation
7.1 Discussion Points
Should auctions be part of Phase 1 MVP?


Pros: Could attract more users through competitive bidding.


Cons: May increase complexity and delay release.


Payment Escrow System:


Currently not implemented. Should we hold rental fees in escrow until item return?


Chat Architecture:


Use WebSockets (Socket.io) or Supabase Realtime for MVP?


WebSockets offer flexibility but require more backend scaling.


7.2 Open Questions
Late Return Policy: Should penalties be automatically calculated or just notifications sent?


User Verification: Do we need KYC (e.g., phone verification) for high-value rentals?


Geo-Fencing: Should users only see items within a configurable radius (e.g., 10 km)?


Data Storage: Should images be optimized via a CDN (e.g., CloudFront) from day one?
